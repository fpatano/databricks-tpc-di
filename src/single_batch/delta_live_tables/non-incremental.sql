-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC * Some complexity in "how" to handle the conameorcik. If its numeric, its a cik ID. If its not numeric, its the coname. 
-- MAGIC * Therefore, handle the join to DimCompany by determining whether its numeric or not - but this requires 2 joins to DimCompany (when writing as 1 join and doing OR in the join condition it slowed it down because it used BNLJ)
-- MAGIC * Also need to handle the case where DimCompany record updates in-between the effective/end date for the Security record. So need to check if DimCompany record end date is before the end date of the security record (also test the other way where the effective date of DimCompany is after the effective date of security record).  This is because the join where date is between the DimCompany effective/end dates will match multiple records if the DimCompany record was updated during the duration of the Security record
